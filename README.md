Super Mario Bros. is considered as one of the most popular video game that was released in 1985 for
the Nintendo Entertainment System. In this game the player takes on the role of Mario, who must
navigate through a difficult landscape and reach the finish line by performing multiple actions such
as walking, running, and jumping in combination with the directional movements. Mario gathers
coins while avoiding or destroying adversaries who can take his life if they come into contact with
him. The game requires precise button inputs to effectively complete various complex platforming
challenges over a broad collection of levels and stages.
Super Mario Bros. is a computationally challenging game and clearly falls into NP-Hard category,
with the complexity arising from the arbitrary size of the playing field. Due to the fact that the player
only sees a fraction of the total environment dependent on Marioâ€™s present position, obstacles and
adversary arrive and exit the frame in a seamless side scrolling platform. The seemingly arbitrarily,
long and unpredictable paths of each setting make implementing Reinforcement Learning to this
problem, an intriguing and fascinating challenge to investigate.
